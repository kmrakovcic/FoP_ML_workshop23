        "Leaving all the intuition aside, only strictly looking, neural networks is just a function with a lot of parameters. Learning is just optimizing the parameters to the data. Only issue is how to create optimization algorithm that is robust enough to work in the parameter space that has order of magnitude million dimensions? Currently the most used algorithm is called **\"Gradient descent\"** and it's application in the neural networks which we call **\"Backpropagation\"**.\n",
